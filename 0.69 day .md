we are given hint about the mails so we know he was using some mailing software.

and we found outlook in the pslist

`python3 vol.py -f '/home/kali/Desktop/forensics kaam/summer/memdump.mem' windows.pslist `

![outlook](https://github.com/adwait3/forensics-ST/assets/148553626/b7a526d2-c707-4751-a86b-9129ffd24de1)

after some brainwrecking i found out that we need to find the CVE of an exploit and not anything related to a mail so we need a different approach i found out cve is a vunerability matrix so we need to find out what vunribiltiy was exploited by the hacker
so i use cmdline plugin to see cmd line processes as they have a higher chance of being used in an exploit

`python3 vol.py -f '/home/kali/Desktop/forensics kaam/summer/memdump.mem' windows.cmdline `

i see a weird winrar file so i dum it

then i used 

```
python3 vol.py -f '/home/kali/Desktop/forensics kaam/summer/memdump.mem' windows.filescan | grep .zip

```
