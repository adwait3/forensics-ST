we see the protocol being used is MPEG -1

``designed to compress VHS-quality raw digital video and CD audio down to about 1.5 Mbit/s (26:1 and 6:1 compression ratios respectively) without excessive quality loss``

it is basically a protocol for pictures and audio and stands for Moving Picture Experts Group Phase 1 (MPEG-1)
